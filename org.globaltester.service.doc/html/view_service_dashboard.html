<h2>GT Service Dashboard</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>GlobalTester</strong></span> contains (depending on installed features) several background services, 
        e.g. for remote control or simulation of chip cards. 
        
        The status of these services can be monitored (or changed) through the optional <strong>GT Service Dashboard</strong>. This view is not visible by default but can be activated from the Window menu just like any other view.   
            
            <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="../images/view_service_dashboard.png" align="middle"></div>
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: While this view allows modification of the status of several services keep in mind that most of these services can be configured in the preferences and in general no manual modification here is needed. 
        For example all testcases delivered by secunet automatically start their required simulator automatically. If you interfere with this automatically started simulators expect your test to fail.
